# BattleDrive Competition

This project is the official website of my association, BattleDrive Competition. This association has been created to take part at rallies and to find some partners in order to help us reducing our cost. He shows our partners, our goal and presents the BattleDrive team.

Big thanks to Martin Rizand Photographie for the main background image and R2S Location for Clio's pictures.
